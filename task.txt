For the main tasks:
Add more words using the SQL Query (at least have 50 words).
Make a function to Query all the words and replace it with list that we have right now for the main.py
Make a temporary SQL Query to add the values into the leaderboard Table.
For the extra tasks:
Design the index.html as well as to put more content into the wordle_page.html
Try and make a Table for the leaderboard to be shown in a new page (name the page with the right method).
This will be their homework for this week, if they have any question about the task either you can ask them to take a look at M6L4.Structure of a database eng and their task 8, they already have everything down and just need to modify the command/queries.
